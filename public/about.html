<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ahmad Abdelrahim, a second year Computer engineering at Memorial University of NFLD. My passion for engineering came from watching my father
developing innovating methods to solve problems, which resonates with me a lot. I come from an athletic background, where I have been playing football for 
11 years and competing in multiple competitions. My passion for software developing comes from my willingness to develop creative solutions
to worldwide problems and positively impacting my community through a fun way that I personally enjoy.</p>

<p>I am 22 years old and I am first diving into the web development field as I want to have a piece from the ever-growing technology industry.
I have big dreams of implementing innovative measures to ensure people's security online and creating a safe space online for people away from
frauds and scams and blackmailing.</p>
